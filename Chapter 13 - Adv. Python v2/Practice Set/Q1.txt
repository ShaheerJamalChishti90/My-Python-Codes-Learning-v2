ans: I will create a virtual environment using the following command:
python -m venv shaheer_env1 and then I will install the packages using the following command:
pip install numpy==1.0.0

Now, I will create a similar environment in the second one using the following command:
python -m venv shaheer_env2 and then I will install the packages using the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt
